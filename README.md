# Portfolio

These are the Jupyter Notebooks which shows the implementation of the projects that I have undertaken. The projects involves application of Pandas Library for Data Analysis and for Data Visualisation I have used Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Along with the Data Analysis and Visualisation, the next step in a project is to train the model based on type of problem we are trying to solve for e.g Regression or Classification or Unsupervised Learning Problems like Clustering.
I have used Scikit-Learn Library for training the models.
